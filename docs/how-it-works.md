# How It Works

At CTX-EOR, we’ve designed a hiring and employment experience that puts **control, compliance, and confidence** into the hands of North American businesses.

We act as your **Employer of Record**, but with structure, strategy, and service levels that go far beyond check-the-box providers.

---

## Step 1: You Identify the Role

Bring us the role you need to fill — whether it's high-volume entry-level or a niche specialist. You can define the job, or we can help you clarify based on similar hiring patterns and market intelligence.

---

## Step 2: We Source and Screen Candidates

We handle sourcing or work with your recruiting funnel. Every candidate goes through a structured screening and qualification process that respects their time and yields better-fit hires.

We verify eligibility, collect onboarding documents, and handle tax/employment setup. You stay hands-off — no paperwork chaos.

---

## Step 3: Trial Employment Starts

This is where CTX-EOR shines.

Each candidate starts a **trial evaluation period** as a W-2 employee of CTX. You get to observe real performance in your environment before making a long-term commitment.

You can give us feedback mid-trial or walk away risk-free.

---

## Step 4: You Decide — Keep, Replace, or Extend

After the evaluation:
- **Hire directly** if they’re a great fit
- **Request a replacement** if it didn’t work out
- **Extend the trial** if you need more time

You only convert candidates who earn the spot.

## Step 5: We Handle the Back Office

CTX-EOR manages:
- Payroll and tax filings
- Benefits and HR compliance
- Employment liability
- Ongoing employee support

You get the people. We take the risk.

---

## Built for the U.S. — Not for the World

Most EORs are designed for **global hiring**. That’s not us.

We specialize in **U.S.-based employment**, which means:
- Real compliance with U.S. state and federal laws
- Accurate payroll, onboarding, and worker classification
- No awkward “international” workarounds

---

## Why It Works

This isn’t theory. It’s a structured, field-tested model that:
- Improves retention
- Reduces mis-hires
- Supports scale
- Provides legal coverage

Let’s build your team the right way.
