# How It Works

## Trial Hiring, Without the Risk

We make it easy to evaluate new talent on the job — before making a full-time offer.

Here’s how the CTX-EOR model works from start to finish:

---

## Step 1: You Choose the Candidate

You identify the worker you want to trial.  
We can support your screening process — or stay out of it.

> Want help? Our screening options include:
> - Job-specific questions
> - Recorded video responses
> - Human-conducted interviews
> - Background checks and eligibility confirmation

---

## Step 2: We Onboard and Employ Them

CTX-EOR becomes the **legal employer** for the trial period.  
We handle:

- IRS-compliant payroll  
- State-by-state tax withholding  
- I-9 identity verification  
- Benefits setup (if applicable)  
- Digital onboarding  
- Legal paperwork, W-4s, and more

All without slowing you down.

---

## Step 3: You Evaluate, We Cover the Rest

The worker joins your team and does the job — just like any employee.  
You manage their schedule, tasks, and expectations.  
We remain responsible for:

- Legal employment  
- Payroll & compliance  
- Recordkeeping & documents  
- Benefits and time-off tracking (if enabled)

> 💡 You get full insight and control — without the administrative load.

---

## Step 4: You Decide What’s Next

At the end of the trial, you choose:

- ✅ They’re a great fit → Convert them to your payroll  
- ❌ Not the right match → We handle the offboarding

No risk. No entanglements. Just a clearer decision.
