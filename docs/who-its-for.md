# Who We Serve

**CTX-EOR** is purpose-built for one thing:  
**Helping U.S. employers trial talent before committing to a full hire.**

---

## 👥 Ideal for These Scenarios

| Use Case | Why CTX-EOR Works |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Startups & Growth-Stage Teams** | You need to move fast — but you can’t afford a bad hire. Trial work shows you who’s ready to go. |
| **Companies without HR teams** | We handle onboarding, payroll, and compliance so you don’t have to. |
| **Hiring across state lines** | No need to register in every state. We’re the employer. We handle it. |
| **Trying before hiring** | Want to test culture fit, skills, or reliability? Our trial process makes it legal and simple. |
| **Remote-first teams** | Candidates can be anywhere. We handle ID verification, I-9, and remote compliance. |
| **Workforce compliance concerns** | Avoid fines, audits, or misclassification. We take on the legal employer role. |

- ❌ Global employment (we only operate within the U.S.)
