# Structured Evaluation

### Build a Better Team—Backed by Real Feedback

At CTX-EOR, we believe hiring isn’t just about filling a seat—it’s about building long-term strength. That’s why every trial includes a structured evaluation process designed to support better decisions.

## 📋 Manager Insights, Not Just Metrics

We prompt your team’s managers or direct supervisors with simple, recurring check-ins:

- Is this person **on pace** for success?
- Are there any **early warning signs**?
- How well are they adapting to your environment?

This isn’t another HR form. It’s a quick-touch process that keeps quality top of mind, and creates a useful record of early performance.

## 📆 Designed to Fit Your Workflow

You decide:
- **Who** gives the feedback
- **How often** they’re prompted
- What kind of **rating language** makes sense for your team

Our team configures it with you during setup—and the process runs smoothly in the background.

## 🎯 Stronger Hires, Better Teams

The outcome? A consistent framework that gives your hiring decisions real structure. It’s ideal for:
- Hiring at scale
- Trying out early-career candidates
- Giving non-HR managers better support
