# Evaluate Real Performance — Not Just Potential

## The CTX-EOR Evaluation Advantage

We believe the best hiring decisions come *after* someone starts working — not before. With CTX-EOR, you're not guessing from a résumé or relying on interviews alone. You're observing real work, under real conditions, with real stakes.

---

## A 90-Day, Purpose-Built Trial Period

Every CTX-EOR engagement is backed by a structured 90-day trial designed to help you answer two key questions:

1. **Are they meeting or exceeding expectations?**
2. **Are they someone you'd hire again — without hesitation?**

You’re not alone in answering those questions. Our system is designed to support you.

---

## Supervisor Feedback. Standardized. Simple.

Managers and team leads receive periodic prompts throughout the trial:

- 🔁 **30-60-90 Day Check-Ins**
- 📊 Quick scoring with 1–5 slider
- 🗣️ Optional context for what’s working — or not
- ✨ Just one prompt per check-in, auto-generated based on role

No paperwork. No HR bottlenecks. Just consistent, structured signal.

---

## Built-in Confidence. And Documentation.

Our system helps employers:

✅ Spot red flags before they become problems  
✅ Document progress in case of promotion or exit  
✅ Align decision-making across the team

Whether you're growing fast or being extra careful — structured evaluation gives you the visibility you need to make the right call.
