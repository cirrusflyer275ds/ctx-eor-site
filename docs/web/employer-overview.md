# Employer Overview

## Trial Hiring, Fully Covered

Hireway exists to solve one critical problem: **How can you try a new hire before committing — without exposing your business to compliance risk?**

We’re the answer.  
You focus on evaluating fit.  
We handle everything else.

---

## What We Handle

Hireway is the **legal employer** of record for your trial-period hires. That means we’re responsible for:

- ✅ Worker classification (W-2, not 1099)
- ✅ Federal & state tax compliance
- ✅ Payroll processing & wage remittance
- ✅ I-9 verification and onboarding
- ✅ Background screening
- ✅ Benefits administration (optional)

All while the worker is actively contributing to your team — on your terms.

---

## What You Control

You still control:

- Who to evaluate  
- What work they do  
- How long the trial lasts  
- When (and whether) to convert to a full hire

We simply make sure everything is **legal**, **compliant**, and **easy** during that period.
