# 🔍 Step 12: Screening & Background Check

Some jobs require a background check or drug screening. If this role does, we’ll guide the candidate through it quickly and securely.

---

## What the Candidate Sees

> “To move forward, we need your authorization to run a background check. This helps employers ensure a safe and trustworthy workplace.”

---

## Part 1: Background Check Authorization

✅ Candidate reviews a disclosure + authorization PDF  
✅ Candidate checks box:  
> “I have read and authorize CTX-EOR to conduct a background check.”

🗂️ File is stored in the onboarding record for compliance

---

## Part 2: Drug Screening (If Required)

If the role includes drug screening:

- 🎯 **Candidate selects a nearby testing location**
- 📅 **Chooses an available date and time**
- 📩 **Receives appointment confirmation + reminders via SMS/email**
- 📋 CTX tracks completion status via API (e.g. Checkr or vendor)

---
