# The CTX Platform

At CTX-EOR, our platform isn’t just software—it’s your workforce operations partner.

Whether you’re onboarding your first worker or scaling a regional team, CTX gives you a clean, guided experience to manage employment without the stress.

## Built for North American Employers

We don’t claim to be everywhere. We focus where it counts: the U.S. and Canada. Our tools are fine-tuned to handle the complexity of:
- Federal and state-level compliance
- City-specific labor rules
- Cross-border employment for U.S./Canadian hires

## Everything in One Place

- **Digital Onboarding**: W-4, I-9, direct deposit, benefits—done in minutes.
- **Integrated Payroll**: We pay your team, remit taxes, and generate documents.
- **Live Trial Tracking**: Want to “test drive” talent? We support structured evaluations and trial periods before full hiring decisions.
- **Audit-Ready Records**: From time tracking to tax docs, everything’s organized and exportable.

## Made for Modern Teams

- Mobile-first
- Manager-friendly
- Audit-safe
- Candidate-supportive

> CTX isn’t a temp agency. It’s how serious teams get compliant, flexible help—without the overhead of hiring full-time.
