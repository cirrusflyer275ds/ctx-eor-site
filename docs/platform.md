Our platform includes:

✅ Structured onboarding with audit trail  
✅ Timed trial periods with automated check-ins  
✅ Manager prompts to assess real-world performance

## Everything in One Seamless Flow

From day one, we coordinate all the moving parts:

1. **Invite & Setup**  
   You define the role and candidate. We handle the paperwork.

2. **Onboarding & Compliance**  
   Tax forms, I-9, background screening — completed and filed.

3. **Trial Period Begins**  
   We guide the evaluation process through regular check-ins.

4. **Decision Time**  
   You get real data, not interview impressions.

5. **Make the Call**  
   Ready to hire? Great. Not a fit? No problem — we manage the offboarding.
