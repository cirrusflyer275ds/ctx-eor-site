# About Hireway

Hiring has changed.  
We're here to help you change with it.

## Built for the Future of Work

Hireway was founded to help U.S. companies hire better ‚Äî faster, smarter, and with less risk.

In a market flooded with global providers, we focus where it matters:  
**North American employers who need real results.**

We're not a temp agency.  
We're not an overseas outsourcing shop.  
We're a compliance engine, a payroll platform, and a hiring ally ‚Äî rolled into one.

## Who We Serve

- U.S.-based companies of all sizes
- Founders and teams who want to **‚Äútest before they invest‚Äù**
- Companies exploring **fractional or phased hiring**
- Managers who want to evaluate performance before extending a full offer

Whether you're hiring your 2nd team member or your 20th, Hireway gives you the structure to do it right.
