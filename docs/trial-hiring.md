### 🧪 What Is Trial Hiring?

Trial hiring is your **hiring probation, modernized**.

- You define the role, pay, duration (4-week minimum)
- Candidate becomes a **fully onboarded employee of CTX-EOR**
- You direct their work. We handle the compliance.
- At the end of the trial? Hire or walk away — no strings attached.

### 🔍 The Problem with Traditional Hiring

- Gut feel interviews ≠ actual job performance
- 60% of bad hires are discovered **after** onboarding
- Traditional EORs focus on **scale**, not **fit**

**We fix that.**
