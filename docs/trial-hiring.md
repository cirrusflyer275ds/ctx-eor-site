# Trial Hiring with CTX-EOR

## The Problem with Conventional Hiring

| ❌ Common Challenge | 💡 CTX-EOR Advantage |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Hiring based on interviews is risky | Trial hires reveal performance, fit, and reliability |
| HR overhead slows decision-making | We handle payroll, taxes, compliance, and onboarding |
| Termination risk creates hesitation | We carry the employment relationship during the trial |

## Your Trial, Our Compliance

CTX-EOR acts as the **Employer of Record (EOR)** during the trial period. That means:

- **You control the work** — they’re on your schedule, doing your tasks.
- **We carry the risk** — payroll, I-9s, W-4s, state registrations, benefits.
- **You stay flexible** — convert to hire when ready, or part ways with no red tape.

> 🛡️ We’re not a staffing firm. We’re a platform for flexible, compliant trial hiring — purpose-built for modern teams.
