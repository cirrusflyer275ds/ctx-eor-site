# Real Benefits. From Day One.

Just because it’s a trial doesn’t mean you cut corners.  
We offer real benefits from trusted providers — without delay.

---

## What’s Included

Whether the trial lasts a few weeks or a few months, your team members get:

✅ **Major Medical Insurance** — PPO coverage, ACA-compliant plans  
✅ **Dental & Vision** — Preventive care and routine coverage  
✅ **401(k) Retirement** — Full-service plan with employee access  
✅ **Sick Leave & Time Off** — Based on local and state requirements  
✅ **Direct Deposit Payroll** — Weekly or bi-weekly cycles  
✅ **Digital Paystubs & Tax Docs** — All self-serve, all online

## We Handle It All

You don’t need to choose plans, negotiate rates, or figure out compliance — we’ve already done it:

- Plans from **top-rated national carriers**
- Fully managed by CTX-EOR
- No setup or admin burden for your team
- Employees onboard through our digital portal

---

## Designed for Small & Growing Teams

Most benefit providers won’t talk to you unless you have 10+ employees.  
We built CTX-EOR to support companies with:

- **1–25 team members**
- **Non-standard work trials**
- **Flexible, scalable teams**

You get the infrastructure of a big company without becoming one.

## Optional Employer Subsidy

You can contribute to employee health coverage if you'd like:

- Fixed dollar amount per month  
- Or a percentage of plan cost  
- Set during trial creation — we’ll handle the rest

---

## Transparent Pricing

There’s no hidden markup.  
You see what your workers see — and you only pay if the worker accepts coverage.

## Optional, Not Required

Employees aren’t forced to accept coverage. But if they do, they get access to:

- Legitimate coverage
- Enrollments handled by us
- No gaps between trial and hire
