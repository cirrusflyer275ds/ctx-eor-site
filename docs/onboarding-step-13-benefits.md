# 🏥 Step 13: Health Benefits Enrollment

Some trials include the option to enroll in medical, dental, and vision benefits. If this one does, here’s how it works.

## What We Collect

✅ **Who needs coverage?**  
- Just me  
- Me and my spouse  
- Me and children  
- The whole family

✅ **Are you married?**  
✅ **Any dependents to include?** *(Names/birthdates not collected here)*

✅ **How much are you comfortable spending per paycheck?**  
→ Used to suggest plan options based on deductible levels and employer subsidy.
