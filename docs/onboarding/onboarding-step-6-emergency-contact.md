# 🆘 Step 6: Emergency Contact

Every employee needs a trusted emergency contact — just in case.

We ask candidates to provide:

- Full name
- Relationship to the candidate
- Phone number

---

## Why It Matters

✅ Required for workplace safety  
✅ Helps in case of injury or urgent medical events  
✅ Securely stored and never shared outside the employer relationship

---

## Fast and Friendly Flow

This step is designed to be:

- Quick and mobile-friendly
- Skippable with a “Remind Me Later” in preview/demo mode
- Required for real onboarding completion

---

## Built-In Validations

- Phone number formatting
- No duplicate entry with candidate's own info
- One contact is the default minimum (additional optional)
