# 📋 Step 7: Work Rules & Acknowledgment

Every employer has rules — we make it simple for candidates to read and acknowledge them.

---

## What Happens in This Step

- The candidate is shown a **PDF or web-rendered document** containing work rules, policies, or expectations provided by the customer.
- The candidate clicks **“I Acknowledge”** to move forward.

No downloads, uploads, or signature collection required. Just clean acknowledgment.

---

## Features

✅ Mobile-friendly reader  
✅ Scroll-to-acknowledge enforcement  
✅ Reminder if skipped or closed early

---

## Use Cases

- Workplace behavior expectations  
- Time and attendance guidelines  
- Health and safety reminders  
- Dress code or device policy

---

## Compliance-Ready

All acknowledgments are:

- Logged with date/time stamp  
- Stored in candidate's onboarding record  
- Attached to the final onboarding PDF packet
