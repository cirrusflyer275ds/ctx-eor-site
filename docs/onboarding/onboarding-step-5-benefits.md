# 🏥 Step 5: Benefits & Coverage

We offer short-term major medical coverage to all candidates — with options to include spouses and dependents.

Benefits are powered by trusted providers (like UnitedHealthcare or similar), and employer subsidies are supported when offered.

---

## How It Works

- Candidates select if they want coverage
- Choose who it’s for: self, spouse, children
- Pick a deductible level they’re comfortable with
- View plan options and pricing based on state of residence
- Subsidies (if available) are displayed in real time

---

## Smart Defaults + Compliance

✅ Default “opt-out” if benefits are not required  
✅ No personal dependent info collected in this step (names, DOBs collected later at enrollment)  
✅ Data passed securely to enrollment partner (e.g., Ideon)

---

## Candidate-Friendly Experience

- Clear language explaining cost and value
- Soft UI elements and guided choices
- Mobile-first and self-serve

---

## Employer Flexibility

- Set fixed dollar subsidies or % contributions per trial
- Configure plan visibility based on job or department
- Option to disable this step if not needed
