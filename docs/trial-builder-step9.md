## 📌 Check-in Milestones

At each milestone, we’ll prompt your manager or supervisor with a **structured feedback question** based on the role.

- ✅ 30-Day Check-in  
  “How is this candidate adapting to your team and expectations?”

- ✅ 60-Day Check-in  
  “What skills or habits are they showing that indicate long-term fit?”

- ✅ 90-Day Check-in  
  “Would you hire this person full-time today? Why or why not?”

You can customize these prompts later or skip certain check-ins.

## 📊 Go/No-Go Decision Support

Each response feeds into your private dashboard to help you answer the ultimate question:

> “Is this person a long-term fit for our team?”

## 🚨 What If You’re Unsure?

If you're not sure after 90 days — you can:
- Extend the trial (we’ll handle the update)
- End the engagement (no termination headaches)
- Or request a second opinion (e.g. peer feedback or role switch)
