# 🕵️‍♂️ Step 4: Screening & Background Checks

We integrate screening into the onboarding flow so there are no surprises — and no delays.

Whether your trial requires a background check, a drug test, or both, we guide the candidate through it with clarity and transparency.

## What’s Included?

- **Background Check (via Checkr)**  
  Standard identity + criminal history report.  
  Candidates are prompted to acknowledge a digital disclosure and authorization.

- **Drug Testing (if required)**  
  Candidate selects a nearby testing site, date, and time.  
  Reminder notifications and confirmation logic built in.

## Candidate Experience

✅ Clear explanation of what’s required  
✅ Mobile-first flow to select testing center and time

✅ Real-time appointment verification through Checkr

## Employer Confidence

We’ll notify your team when checks are cleared. Failed or missed screenings trigger escalation to our support team.

All results are stored securely and reviewed before the candidate is confirmed for work.
