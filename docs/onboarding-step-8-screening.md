# üîç Step 8: Background Check & Screening

When required by the employer, we handle background checks and drug screenings seamlessly ‚Äî with full transparency and candidate control.

---

## What Happens in This Step

1. **Disclosure & Authorization**  
   Candidates are shown a digital version of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) disclosure and authorization form.

2. **Background Screening via Checkr**  
   Upon acknowledgment, we trigger a background check using our Checkr integration.

3. **Optional Drug Screening**  
   If required by the employer, the candidate selects a testing location and time.

4. **Appointment Confirmation & Reminder Flow**  
   Candidates receive SMS/email reminders. Missed appointments trigger a support escalation.
