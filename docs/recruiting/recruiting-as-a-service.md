# Recruiting as a Service

Our Recruiting as a Service (RaaS) model transforms how employers identify, assess, and trial candidates. Rather than rely on outdated staffing paradigms, CTX-EOR builds a fully integrated, data-driven recruiting experience that aligns with each customer’s industry, geography, and hiring goals.

## Step 1: Employer Profile + Job Blueprint

* Employers select their NAICS code and define the role they want to fill.
* Using BLS and O\*NET data, we surface the top-matched SOC codes.
* Each SOC unlocks a role blueprint: skills, qualifications, experience, and worker traits.
* Employers fine-tune these attributes to match their internal expectations.

## Step 2: Market-Optimized Ad Campaigns

* Based on the role profile and region, CTX-EOR generates advertising content with:

  * Appropriate tone/voice
  * Required and preferred qualifications
  * Localized language and compensation expectations
  * Platform-specific best practices (Indeed, Craigslist, niche job boards)
* Employers approve campaign copy before launch.

## Step 3: Smart Screening

* All applicants enter a structured screening flow:

  * Resume collection (if applicable)
  * Location, availability, and basic qualifications check
  * Work eligibility and background disclosure
  * Experience alignment: O\*NET work activities vs self-reported history
  * Optional personality/work style questions
* AI evaluates responses and scores alignment.

## Step 4: Live Video Interview

* Candidates who meet a scoring threshold are invited to a short (5-10 min) video interview.
* Conducted by a CTX-EOR recruiter using the employer-approved evaluation outline.
* Interviews are recorded and transcribed.
* Interviewer summarizes results and flags standout comments/concerns.

## Step 5: Trial Invite + Handoff

* Employer receives a candidate packet:

  * Summary score and rank
  * Interview highlights
  * Full transcript and video
* Employer decides whether to invite the candidate to a paid trial.
* Upon approval, candidate enters the onboarding process.

## Why It Matters

* This workflow provides clarity, consistency, and candidate data from Day 1.
* Employers control their inputs (role definition, dealbreakers, tone).
* CTX-EOR manages sourcing, evaluation, and presentation.
* Customers never have to guess about a candidate's fit—they see and decide.

This service is especially useful for companies that want:

* A recruiting partner who understands their industry
* Less wasted time on bad interviews
* Proof of performance before making hiring commitments

> This approach can be layered onto trial hiring for even stronger results.
